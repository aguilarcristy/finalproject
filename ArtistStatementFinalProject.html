 <p style="font-family: 'DM Sans'; color:Black; font-size: 20px;">
 With recent events and the breaking news that the Supreme Court had created a draft to
 overturn Roe v. Wade, I feel it is necessary to talk about how women should have control
 over the bodies that they have.

 As controversial as this may be, having control and autonomy over one's body is a
 human right that is granted to men, but not womxn or individuals who have a uterus.

<br>
<br>
      We are fighting for basic human rights, and I hope that in some way, this project
	  educates you.
